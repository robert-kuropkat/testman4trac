A Trac plugin to create Test Cases, organize them in catalogs, generate test plans and track their execution status and outcome.

This module provides a framework to help creating workflows around any Trac Resource.

Features:
    * Declarative definition of the workflow, specified in trac.ini.
    * Same syntax as the basic Ticket workflow (I may have derived
      some line of code from Trac itself... ;-))
    * Easy GUI integration support. You can expose the workflow 
      operation widgets anywhere in your application pages.
    * Fine-grained authorization control. You can specify which role
      is required to perform each state transition, and to execute
      each corresponding action.
    * Custom actions. An open API allows you to program your own 
      custom actions to be executed at any workflow state transition.
    * Out-of-the-box built-in actions are provided.
